#include	"iir-filters.h"
//
//	just a simple class to include elementary squelch handling
//	The basic idea is that when there is no signal, the noise
//	in the upper bands will be roughly as high as in the lowerbands.
//	Measurement shows that the average amplitude of the noise in the
//	upper band is roughly 0.6 times that of the lower part.
//	The basic idea is to suppress the signal if the average
//	signal value of the upper part is larger than factor times the
//	average signal value of the lower part, where factor is a
//	value between 0 .. 1, set by the user.
